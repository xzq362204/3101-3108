"""A factory test to check the secdata version.

Description
-----------
This test checks if the secdata version is the expected version.

Secdata is set by AP firmware. If the test fails, please confirm the expected
secdata version with the firmware team, and check if the AP firmware is too old.

According to platform/vboot_reference/firmware/2lib/include/2secdata_struct.h,
secdata version is an 8-bit integer defined as (major << 4 | minor << 0).

Test Procedure
--------------
This is an automatic test that doesn't need any user interaction.
Ideally the test should always pass. However, if the test fails, we need to
clear secdata and let the system regenerate it again. It can be done by

  - Re-enable cr50 factory mode (`gsctool -a -F enable`), or
  - Run `chromeos-tpm-recovery` by "(T) Reset TPM" action or "(R) Reset" action
    in a factory shim, depending on whether the device is finalized or not


Dependency
----------
- `tpmc`

Examples
--------
To verify that secdata version is 1.0::

  {
    "pytest_name": "check_secdata_version",
    "disable_services": [
      "trunksd"
    ],
    "args": {
      "major_version": 1,
      "minor_version": 0
    }
  }
