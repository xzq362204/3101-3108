"""Checks that the partition table extends nearly to the end of the storage
device.

Description
-----------
This test checks if the partition table allocates at least ``min_usage_pct``
percent of the storage. If not, this test expands stateful patition to the end
of the storage device by default.

This test doesn't check the actual size of the stateful partition, rather the
sector at which it ends.

This test doesn't support remote device.

Test Procedure
--------------
This is an automatic test that doesn't need any user interaction.

Dependency
----------
- `pygpt` utility.

Examples
--------
To run this pytest with default arguments, add this in test list::

  {
    "pytest_name": "partition_table"
  }

This is also predefined in ``generic_common.test_list.json`` as
``PartitionTable``.

If you can't expand stateful partition for some reason, override the argument
by::

  {
    "inherit": "PartitionTable",
    "args": {
      "expand_stateful": false
    }
  }
