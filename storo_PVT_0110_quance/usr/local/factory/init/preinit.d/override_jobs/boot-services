# This file should be synced with /etc/init/boot-services.conf but remove all
# dependancies of "start on", except "startup" job.

# This job is override for b/137918214. Because we currently utilize "initctl
# reload-configuration" to reload the configs of init to inhibit jobs. For the
# current upstart version used in chromeos (v1.2), it will also accedently clear
# the "stopped" events of finished jobs. That is, all jobs finished before
# executing reloading will be considered as still running. This result the
# boot-services jobs will not be started and wait forever. As the workaround, we
# remove all dependancies of boot-services job.

start on stopped startup
stop on stopping pre-shutdown
