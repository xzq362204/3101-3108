The files that are required to run the WebGL Aquarium test will be fetched from
BCS during build. If you want to get the files manually, you can just run:

  emerge-<board> chromeos-factory

and then copy out the files from:

  /build/<board>/usr/local/factory/py/test/pytests/webgl_aquarium_static


### Instructions to build the tarball

The file 'webgl-aquarium.tar.bz2' on BCS was created from the sources of:

  https://code.google.com/p/webglsamples/

You have to check out the source code with mecurial. Once you have the source
code, do the following modifications:

  1. cd to the aquarium/ directory.
  2. Remove source_asserts/ to reduce size.
  3. Manually copy khronos/, jquery-ui-1.8.2.custom/, tdl/ directories from the
     upper-level directory.
  4. Modify index.html to point the src of all the script tags to current
     directory instead of upper-level directory.

and finally, run:

  tar -jcvf webgl-aquarium.tar.bz2 *

to generate the tarball and upload to BCS. After you upload the tarball to BCS,
go to:

  https://storage.cloud.google.com/?arg=chromeos-localmirror

switch to distfiles/, find the tarball you created, and check "Share Publicly".
