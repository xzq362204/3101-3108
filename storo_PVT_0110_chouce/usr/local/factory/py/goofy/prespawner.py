"""A library to prespawn pytest processes to minimize startup overhead.

There are several possible ways to run pytest in a clean environment:

1. Spawn the pytest runner when the pytest is started.
   Even for simple pytests like message, the time it takes to start Python and
   import dependencies takes about 200ms on a ChromeOS laptop, and could take
   much longer for devices with lower computing power.

2. fork and import the pytest module directly.
   There are several global objects (logging, event_log) that we need to reset
   when in the child process, to ensure that the environment when running
   pytest is clean.
   Also, Goofy server itself is multithreaded, and it's generally not a good
   idea to fork from a multithreaded process.

3. Prespawn some process and use them when pytest is started.
   This is the current approach. We prespawn pytest runner in a background
   thread. When pytest is started, we get one prespawned process and feed the
   pytest info to it.
   This avoid the problem in 1. since most common import can be imported by
   pytest runner, and would be done in background before pytest is started.
   Also, it's much easier to ensure that the environment for running pytest is
   clean.
