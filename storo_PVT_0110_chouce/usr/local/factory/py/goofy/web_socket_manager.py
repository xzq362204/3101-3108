  """Object to manage web sockets for Goofy.

  Brokers between events in the event client infrastructure
  and on web sockets.  Also tails the console log and sends
  events on web sockets when new bytes become available.

  Each Goofy instance is associated with a UUID.  When a new web
  socket is created, we send a hello event on the socket with the
  current UUID.  If we receive a keepalive event with the wrong
  UUID, we disconnect the client.  This insures that we are always
  talking to a client that has a complete picture of our state
  (i.e., if the server restarts, the client must restart as well).

  Properties:
    tail_buffer: A rotating buffer of the last TAIL_BUFFER_SIZE lines,
        to give to new web clients.
