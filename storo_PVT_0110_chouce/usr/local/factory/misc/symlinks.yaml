# A mapping of which binaries to install when, by symlinking the
# binary name to factory.par or factory-mini.par.
#
#   full = install in /usr/local/bin when installing the toolkit
#   mini = install in /usr/local/bin when installing the factory-mini
#       package in the test image.  The binary must work when run as
#       factory-mini.par.
#
# If a binary is symlinked in bin but not present in this list, it is
# never installed into /usr/local/bin.
